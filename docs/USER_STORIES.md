# USER STORIES

## Sprint 1 - Book Registration
US1: As a librarian, I want to register a new book with Book ID, Title, and Author so that it can be stored in the library system.
US2: As a librarian, I want the system to reject duplicate Book IDs so that each book remains uniquely identifiable.

## Sprint 2 - Borrow and Return Book
US3: As a librarian, I want to mark a book as borrowed so that I can track which books are currently in use.
US4: As a librarian, I want to return a borrowed book so that it becomes available again.
US5: As a librarian, I want the system to prevent borrowing of already borrowed books so that incorrect borrowing is avoided.

## Sprint 3 - Library Report
US6: As a librarian, I want to generate a report showing Book ID, Title, Author and Status so that I can quickly view the library inventory status.
